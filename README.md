We 4, as a project in the course Computational Methods and Optimization
came up with an Optimizer which is compared with pre-existing 
optimizers like Adam, RMS Prop and SGD + Momentum.

We tested our Optimizer against the 3 other Optimizers on : 
1. Well Conditioned Quadratic Function
2. Ill Conditioned Quadratic Function
3. Rosenbrock Function
